<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>The Committee recommends to the Legislative Assembly that the provincial government:</p>
<h3>Capital Funding</h3>
<ol start="60">
<li>
  Develop a strategy and proactively fund the construction of new schools at
  elementary, middle and high school levels to meet demand in geographical areas
  of current and anticipated population growth, and to address issues such as
  overcapacity and reliance on portables.
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/CommitteeDocuments/40th-parliament/5th-session/fgs/Reports/FGS-2016-11-15-Report_BudgetConsultation.pdf#page=43">[2016: #45]</a>
</li>
<li>
  Increase the annual facility grant for capital maintenance to ensure proper
  repair, maintenance and upgrades of aging school facilities.
</li>
<li>
  Provide adequate funding for seismic upgrades, accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program, and allow concurrent non-seismic upgrades to take place where appropriate.
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/CommitteeDocuments/40th-parliament/5th-session/fgs/Reports/FGS-2016-11-15-Report_BudgetConsultation.pdf#page=43">[2016: #45]</a>
</li>
<li>
  Provide bridge funding to cover the cost of portables while new schools are
  being constructed.
</li>
<li>
  Streamline the process by which school districts access capital funding from
  concept to completion.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Operational Funding</h3>
<ol start="65">
<li>
  Review the salary compression of exempt staff to ensure that migration into
  administration positions remains attractive.
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/CommitteeDocuments/40th-parliament/5th-session/fgs/Reports/FGS-2016-11-15-Report_BudgetConsultation.pdf#page=43">
    [2016: #48]
  </a>
</li>
<li>
  With broad stakeholder input, review the per-pupil funding formula to develop
  a new needs-based, stable and sustainable model to fund actual costs, resource
  needs, and professional development requirements of each school district.
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/CommitteeDocuments/40th-parliament/5th-session/fgs/Reports/FGS-2016-11-15-Report_BudgetConsultation.pdf#page=43">
    [2016: #48]
  </a>
</li>
<li>
  Increase funding to Community LINK and the Vulnerable Student Supplement, and
  provide a more equitable allocation process of these initiatives among school
  districts.

  curriculum, for LGBTQ inclusive sexual health education, as well as
