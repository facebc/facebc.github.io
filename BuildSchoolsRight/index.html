          We want you to use our quick and easy email tool (below) to tell BC’s
          government leaders that it’s time to update the school design policy.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s why:</b> Everyone knows that BC’s century-old schools are
        seismically unsafe and often contain other health hazards, like asbestos
        and lead. Usually the best way to address these issues is to build a
        brand new replacement school. However, communities overjoyed to welcome
        a safer school are dismayed to find out that the new schools are on
        average 30% smaller than the schools they are replacing, and they lack
        important learning spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is due to the Ministry of Education’s policy (the “Area Standards”)
        that sets out how schools are to be built in BC and determines the
        amount of money that will be budgeted for construction of a school. The
        policy does not allocate space for art rooms, music rooms, adequate
        hallway space, washrooms, staff rooms, sufficient gymnasium space, and
        other necessities for successful learning. BC’s policy allows for less
        space per child than other provinces with similar policies. For more
        information, read

          >PAN’s detailed description of the problems with the Area Standards
          policy</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of problematic new builds include General Gordon
        Elementary, where the new school is too small to accommodate the
        children in its catchment; Eric Hamber Secondary, where the proposed
        replacement school will be built without an auditorium/performing arts
        theatre and with less gym space; and Bayview Elementary, which will lose
        its kiln—a crucial part of its fine arts program—because there is no
        space for it in the proposed replacement school. While these are
        Vancouver schools, this is not a Vancouver-specific issue. The policy
        applies to new school construction throughout the province.

          >The Ministry of Education has responded</a

        to concerns about this policy by stating that it plans to review the
        policy but in the meantime districts have “flexibility” to design
        schools as long as they stay within budget. This is not satisfactory:
        How can an art room, music room, or auditorium be built if the policy
        that decides the budget does not allow for it to be included? What other
        necessary spaces, allowed under the policy, would have to be sacrificed
        instead?

            The Ministry of Education’s Area Standards policy is the document
            that sets out how schools are to be built in BC and determines the
            amount of money that will be budgeted for construction of a school.
            The policy details how much space is allowed to be used for given
            purposes, such as classrooms, administration, and so on. Of utmost
            concern is what this policy does NOT allocate space, and therefore
            budget, for: art rooms, music rooms, adequate hallway space,
            washrooms, staff rooms, sufficient gymnasium space, and other
            necessities for successful learning. Furthermore, BC’s policy allows
            for less space per student than other provinces with similar
            policies. The Parent Advocacy Network has detailed the problems with
            the policy here:
            http://www.panvancouver.ca/news/pan-calls-for-an-area-standards-review
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is that replacement schools are on average 30% smaller
            than the schools they are replacing and lack crucial spaces for
            students to engage in the type of creative and individual learning
            that the new curriculum emphasizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ministry has indicated that a review of the policy is coming,
            but in the meantime the Ministry maintains that the policy simply
            determines the budget that is available, and that districts have
            “flexibility” on which spaces to include, as long as they stay
            within budget. This, however, raises the question: How can an art
            room, music room, or auditorium be built if the policy that decides
            the budget does not allow for it to be included? What other
            necessary spaces, allowed under the policy, would have to be
            sacrificed instead?
          </p>
          <p>
            I am asking you as my MLA to urge Minister of Education Rob Fleming
            to speed up the review of this policy, and to ensure that the
            schools we build today are designed to enable holistic student
            success for decades to come.
          </p>
